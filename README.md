# NetworkBehaviourSimulator
Simple demonstration of data, control and management plane behaviour in optical network (EON).

Network consist of four components:
- NMS - Network Management System,
- Client - app for communication,
- Node - optical switch,
- Cloud - representation of cables and links.

Cloud and each NMS require configuration file and parameter (name) passed to executable file. Each node and client require parameters: domanin number and their ID number.
Directory "presentation" contains example of composed network.
